## ⚠️ Help commands

Help commands to refer while building a plugin

```vim
:Telescope help_tags
:Telescope highlights
:help 'runtimepath'
:help help-writing
:help helptags
:help modeline
:help right
:lua vim.print(vim.api)
:help nvim_open_win()
:help nvim_create_buf()
:help nvim_buf_set_option()
:help nvim_get_option()
:help prompt_setcallback()
```

## Special files and folders

- 📁 `lua/`

Runs only when you `require` the file

```vim
:lua require"file"
```

You can use dot(.) operator to access nested folders

```vim
:lua require"file.nestedFile"
```

- 📁 `plugin/`

Runs when neovim is loaded

- 📁 `init.lua`

Runs when the folder that this file is placed in is `require`ed

- 📄 `filetype.lua`

All .lua files will run when `required`ed only once when neovim is started.
If you want to run something every time you `require`ed the file, do this:

```lua
return 5
```

Essentially what it does is every time it runs, the value of `return` is
saved as **cache** in a global table, which can be accessed with:

```lua
:lua vim.print(package.loaded)
```

It is counter intuitive, because it actually does not run multiple time,
it runs one time and save the value in cache for later use. This is done
to save time.

If you really want to re-run the plugin to get updated value, assign the
value of the plugin to `nil` and re-run the plugin to assign updated value
into the package table like so:

```lua
:lua vim.print(package.loaded.plugin_name)=nil
:lua require("plugin_name")
```
